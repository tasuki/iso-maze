- Read the `Makefile` for how to run this.
- Do NOT conform to the Elm code style, instead:
    - Primarily, DO NOT mess with the formatting I already have: it's intentional.
    - Try to match my formatting for any new code you write. Specifically:
        - No line breaks after `=`, unless it's a long line
        - Prefer minimizing vertical white space (but do not remove it completely)
        - Try to put if/else blocks on two lines: one for `if`, one for `else` (unless long)
        - Similar for pattern matching: if the right side is short, keep it on one line and no empty lines
    - Again, if there's vertical white space somewhere, there's a reason for it: do not remove it.
    - If something is formatted a certain way, there's a reason for it: keep the formatting!
