- Read the `Makefile` for how to run this.
- Do NOT conform to the Elm code style, instead:
    - Primarily, DO NOT mess with the formatting I already have - it's intentional.
    - Secondarily, try to match my formatting. Specifically:
        - No line breaks after `=`, unless it's a very long line indeed
        - Keep vertical white space to a minimum
        - Try to put if/else blocks on two lines: one for `if`, one for `else`
        - Similar for pattern matching: if the right side is short, keep it on one line and no empty lines
